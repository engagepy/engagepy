# Sharing == Caring

**How I started coding, exact steps? Read on ..**

> python_learning repository has code written in my learning phase. Python, for it had me at first sight. My journey is not usual, I spent 20s setting up and operating businesses, teaching scuba and making bread in the non code world. 
This code path started around >30< with an objective to build real solutions, add to the open source community, and to hopefully contribute lines of code to something meaningful. The python_learning repository contains nuemerous .py files. Each representing an independent code project apt for beginners. The other repos are exciting too, do check them out. 

**Steps to Initiate:** *(Don't Over Think It. It's Easier Than you Think)*

Don't have to learn code to use code. Here are some steps if you wish to test the waters.

1. Start by downloading python from : https://www.python.org/downloads/ . It is safe, open source, popular and going places. Downloads are secure so ease into it. 

2. Now download this repo (https://github.com/zora89/python_learning) as a .zip by clicking on the down arrow next to the green code button -> 'Download Zip'

3. Continue with instructions on the repository page. 

> Most importantly, if you undertake even a few of these steps then you have the calling to code. It is a bug to eliminate bugs, no way to learn bests; diving right in!

> Since this is my first readme.MD, I hope to keep a connect with it. So I am leaving my future goals below. I'll update them as I progress.
