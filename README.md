**A Learning Journey. I became a scuba instructor at age 22, entreprenuer at 25, hotelier at 28, started self taught coding at 30, still learning at 32** 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on flask and django frameworks.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ML.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on junior developer python roles.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expedited, intensified learning.

# Encouraging Code Learning

**Intro:**

> python_learning repository has code written in my learning phase. Python, for it had me at first sight. My journey is not usual, I spent 20s setting up and operating businesses, teaching scuba and making bread in the non code world. 
This code path started around >30< with an objective to build real solutions, add to the open source community, and to hopefully contribute lines of code to something meaningful. The python_learning repository contains nuemerous .py files. Each representing an independent code project apt for beginners. The other repos are exciting too, do check them out. 

**Steps to Initiate:** *(Don't Over Think It. It's Easier Than you Think)*

One doesn't have to learn code to use code. Here are some steps if you only wish test waters with programming..

1. Start by downloading python from : https://www.python.org/downloads/ . It is safe, open source, popular and going places. Downloads are secure so ease into it. 

2. Now download this repo as a .zip by clicking on the greeen code button. Bottom most option should say "Download Zip"

3. Once in your downloads folder extract it to the desktop *(recommended for ease of locating in terminal)* or any location you prefer. 

4. Now head to the terminal or command, navigate to the directory python_learning you just extracted. *Don't know how to? Learn Terminal(Mac/Linux) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgBd6rjuDQ Learn Command(Windows) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBBWVgE0ewk*

5. By now you should be in the directory using command or terminal. Now type: `python filename.py`   *|| Replace `file name` with any select file from this repo. Make sure it is precise in spelling and case, as is works best. ||*

6. Each file when executed via method in step 5, relays the output on the terminal itself, so look out for that and play along. You'll find useful tax and partner share calculators, few nostalgic games and other fun experiments. Each line I've understood, written and enjoyed, in that order. 

7. Some files may require access tokens and other parameters that are API/system specific. So look out for those and feel free to ask for help @ https://www.zorawarpurohit.com

> Most importantly, if you undertake even a few of these steps then you have the calling to code. It is a bug to eliminate bugs, no way to learn bests; diving right in!

> Since this is my first repo, I hope to keep a connect with it. So I am leaving my future goals below.
I'll update and mark them as I progress. That way if you get past learning and understanding all the code in this repository, you have a roadmap to follow further. What truly set me on this path of learning is nudges from my cousin Sid and Codecademy.
If you find the bug in you: https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python , I'll keep Sid out of this for now ;)
